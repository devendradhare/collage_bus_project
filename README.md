# College Bus Tracking Web App

This is the readme file for the College Bus Tracking Web App, a sophisticated application designed to provide real-time tracking of college buses and students' locations. This app allows users to easily monitor the current location of their college bus and track the whereabouts of individual students.

## How to Use the App

To use the app, please follow these steps:

1. Access the website.
2. Enter your name.
3. If you are a student, click the "I am a student" button.
4. If you are a driver, click the "I am a driver" button and enter your password in the subsequent popup.
5. Once authenticated, a map will be displayed, allowing you to track the bus's location and observe where students are waiting.

Please note the following:

- The app requires an active tab or an unlocked mobile phone to function properly.
- Location permissions must be granted for the app to operate correctly.

## Technologies Used

The following technologies were employed in the development of this application:

- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Backend: Node.js, Socket.IO
- API: Mapbox

### Socket.IO

Web Socket is a communication protocol that enables real-time, bidirectional data exchange between clients and servers over a single, long-lived connection. Socket.IO is used in this project to facilitate instant data transmission, making it ideal for applications requiring real-time updates.

### Mapbox

Mapbox is an API that offers mapping and location-based services. It provides developers with powerful tools and functionalities to incorporate maps and geospatial data into their applications. In this project, Mapbox is utilized to display the map and track the bus and students' locations.
